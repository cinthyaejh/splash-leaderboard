#Hi there!

## Project info

**Context**: 
I enjoyed thinking of new interactions on the leaderboard with Daniel and Phrab, so I decided to make this prototype of the ideas I had :)

## What I did

- Used lovable to get most of the way in replicating current Splash's Kaimix style
- Used Chatgpt to generate an AI image of Kai and Figma to make a new banner.
- Used Cursor to update Typescript code to React, and implement two ideas:
- - Monthly Challenges
- - Regional leaderboards
 
**Challenges**
- Instead of the featured list, which is unclear how one gets chosen or how it's different from Popular, decided to make it Challenges. May challenges is in honor of say silly national/international holidays like "National Donut Day". This was something that used to be very popular ASO marketing strategy for apps and to boost engagement.

**Regional leaderboards**
- Implementation may be hard on this one because have to add another property to the data, but thought would be a fun competitive and curious challenge to filter by country (internally might be good to track where traffic and users come from).

It's all mock data, but thought it would suffice to showcase the idea :) Looking forward to chatting more!
